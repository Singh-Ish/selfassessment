        The Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board requires graduates 
        of engineering programs to possess 12 attributes at the time of 
        graduation. <b> You have been asked to complete a self –assessment 
        of yourself and your group for Graduate Attribute 6: Individual and 
        team work related to your 4th Year Capstone Project </b>. Graduate Attribute 6 represents a student’s
        ability to work effectively as a member and leader in teams, preferably in a multi-disciplinary setting. Graduate
        attribute measurements will not be taken into consideration in determining a student’s grade in the course.
